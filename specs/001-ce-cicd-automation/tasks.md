# Tasks: F5 XC CE CI/CD Automation

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-ce-cicd-automation/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are REQUIRED per constitution TDD standards. Tests must be written FIRST and FAIL before implementation.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)

## Path Conventions
- **Infrastructure project**: `terraform/`, `.github/workflows/`, `tests/`, `scripts/` at repository root
- Module paths: `terraform/modules/<module-name>/`
- Environment paths: `terraform/environments/<env>/`
- All paths are from repository root

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational completion - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on US1 completion (requires existing deployment to update)
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on US1 completion (requires existing deployment to destroy)
- **Polish (Phase N)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT - This is the MVP!
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Requires User Story 1 complete (needs existing deployment to modify)
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Requires User Story 1 complete (needs existing deployment to destroy)
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: SKIPPED FOR MVP (multi-cloud support for future iteration)
- **User Story 5 (P5)**: SKIPPED FOR MVP (rollback feature for future iteration)

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (TDD requirement)

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T009)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T010-T026) - **CRITICAL - blocks all stories**
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T027-T082)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently using quickstart.md
5. Deploy/demo if ready

**This delivers a working, automated CE deployment system!** üéØ

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add Polish phase ‚Üí Final production-ready release

Each story adds value without breaking previous stories.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 1 (Hub VNET + CE AppStack + Load Balancer modules)
   - **Developer B**: User Story 1 (Spoke VNET + CE K8s modules)
   - **Developer C**: User Story 1 (F5 XC Registration module + CI/CD workflows)
3. Stories integrate and complete independently

---

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies - run in parallel
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story for traceability
- **TDD**: Tests written FIRST and must FAIL before implementation (per constitution)
- **Checkpoint**: Stop at each checkpoint to validate story independently
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing (red-green-refactor)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
