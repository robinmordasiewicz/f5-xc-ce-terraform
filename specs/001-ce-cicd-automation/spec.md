# Feature Specification: F5 XC CE CI/CD Automation

**Feature Branch**: `001-ce-cicd-automation`
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create an automation that will deploy an F5 distributed cloud customer edge CE into cloud service providers and automatically register it with the F5 distributerd Cloud console. The deployment should be driven through a CICD pipeline backed by source control managment, where the entire configuration is defined as code. Any changes that need to be made to the architecture will be made through source control best practices and a CICD pipeline will manage the destruction and deployment of resources."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Initial CE Deployment (Priority: P1)

Platform operators need to deploy F5 Distributed Cloud Customer Edge nodes to cloud providers through an automated process. They commit infrastructure configuration to source control, which triggers an automated pipeline that provisions cloud resources and registers the CE with the F5 XC Console without manual intervention.

**Why this priority**: This is the core MVP functionality - the ability to deploy a single CE instance through automation. Without this, the entire automation system cannot function.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by committing a CE configuration to source control and verifying that a functional CE node is deployed to the cloud provider and successfully registered with F5 XC Console.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new CE configuration is committed to source control, **When** the pipeline executes, **Then** cloud infrastructure resources are created and a CE node is provisioned
2. **Given** CE infrastructure is provisioned, **When** the CE initializes, **Then** the CE automatically registers with F5 XC Console using provided credentials
3. **Given** CE registration completes, **When** operator checks F5 XC Console, **Then** the CE appears as "online" with correct metadata (name, site, labels)
4. **Given** deployment completes successfully, **When** operator reviews pipeline logs, **Then** all deployment steps are documented with timestamps and status

---

### User Story 2 - Configuration Updates (Priority: P2)

Platform operators need to modify existing CE deployments by updating configuration in source control. Changes trigger an automated pipeline that safely applies updates or recreates resources as needed, maintaining zero-downtime where possible.

**Why this priority**: After initial deployment capability (P1), operators need the ability to evolve their infrastructure through safe, auditable configuration changes.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by modifying an existing CE configuration in source control (e.g., changing instance size, network settings) and verifying the pipeline applies changes correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an existing CE deployment, **When** configuration is updated in source control, **Then** pipeline detects changes and presents a plan showing what will be modified
2. **Given** a configuration change is approved, **When** pipeline applies updates, **Then** only affected resources are modified while maintaining CE registration
3. **Given** a change requires CE recreation, **When** pipeline executes, **Then** old CE is gracefully deregistered and new CE is deployed and registered
4. **Given** update completes, **When** operator reviews pipeline output, **Then** change summary shows before/after state and verification results

---

### User Story 3 - Infrastructure Destruction (Priority: P3)

Platform operators need to decommission CE deployments through source control. Removing or marking configurations for deletion triggers an automated pipeline that safely deregisters the CE from F5 XC Console and destroys all cloud resources.

**Why this priority**: Complete lifecycle management requires safe teardown capability. While less frequent than deployment/updates, this prevents resource waste and ensures clean decommissioning.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by marking a CE configuration for deletion and verifying the pipeline deregisters the CE and removes all cloud resources without affecting other deployments.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a CE marked for deletion, **When** pipeline executes, **Then** CE is first deregistered from F5 XC Console before infrastructure destruction
2. **Given** deregistration completes, **When** pipeline proceeds, **Then** all cloud resources (compute, network, storage) are destroyed
3. **Given** destruction completes, **When** operator checks cloud provider console, **Then** no orphaned resources remain
4. **Given** pipeline finishes, **When** operator reviews logs, **Then** complete audit trail of decommissioning steps is available

---

### User Story 4 - Multi-Cloud CE Deployment (Priority: P4)

Platform operators need to deploy CE nodes across multiple cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) using consistent configuration patterns. The same pipeline handles provider-specific provisioning while maintaining uniform registration and management processes.

**Why this priority**: Multi-cloud support is valuable but not essential for MVP. Single-cloud automation (P1-P3) must work first before expanding to multiple providers.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by deploying identical CE configurations to different cloud providers and verifying all CEs register correctly with consistent metadata.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** CE configurations for multiple cloud providers, **When** pipeline executes, **Then** provider-specific resources are created correctly for each platform
2. **Given** multi-cloud deployments complete, **When** operator checks F5 XC Console, **Then** all CEs appear with consistent naming and labeling regardless of cloud provider
3. **Given** configurations use cloud-agnostic parameters, **When** pipeline translates to provider APIs, **Then** equivalent resources are created (e.g., network, compute, storage)

---

### User Story 5 - Rollback on Failure (Priority: P5)

Platform operators need automatic rollback when deployments or updates fail. The pipeline detects failures, prevents partial deployments, and can restore previous working state.

**Why this priority**: Safety feature that improves operational confidence but requires basic deployment (P1) and update (P2) capabilities to exist first.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by introducing a configuration error that causes deployment failure and verifying the pipeline rolls back changes and maintains previous working state.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a deployment fails during provisioning, **When** pipeline detects failure, **Then** partially created resources are cleaned up automatically
2. **Given** a CE update fails registration, **When** rollback triggers, **Then** previous CE configuration is restored and registration maintained
3. **Given** rollback completes, **When** operator reviews pipeline logs, **Then** failure reason and rollback actions are clearly documented
4. **Given** rollback restores previous state, **When** operator retries with corrected configuration, **Then** pipeline succeeds without conflicts

### Edge Cases

- What happens when F5 XC Console API is temporarily unavailable during CE registration?
- How does the system handle network connectivity loss between CE and F5 XC Console after initial registration?
- What happens when cloud provider API rate limits are exceeded during bulk deployments?
- How does the system handle CE nodes that successfully provision but fail health checks?
- What happens when source control contains conflicting CE configurations (e.g., duplicate site names)?
- How does the pipeline handle partial cloud provider outages affecting specific availability zones?
- What happens when CE credentials expire or are rotated during deployment?
- How does the system handle deployments that exceed cloud provider quota limits?
- What happens when pipeline execution is interrupted (CI/CD system restart, network failure)?
- How does the system prevent race conditions when multiple pipeline runs target the same CE?

### Key Entities

- **CE Configuration**: Defines desired state of a Customer Edge deployment including cloud provider, region, instance specifications, network settings, F5 XC site details, and registration credentials. Each configuration has unique identifier (site name) and version history.

- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Cloud provider resources required to run CE including compute instances, virtual networks, subnets, security groups, storage volumes, and load balancers. Lifecycle is managed by pipeline.

- **F5 XC Registration**: Relationship between deployed CE node and F5 XC Console including site name, cluster metadata, health status, and credentials. Registration status determines CE operational readiness.

- **Pipeline Execution**: Represents a single automation run including triggered timestamp, configuration version, planned changes, execution logs, status (pending/running/success/failed), and state snapshots.

- **Deployment State**: Current actual state of deployed infrastructure including resource identifiers, CE registration status, configuration version applied, and last successful deployment timestamp.
