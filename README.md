# F5 Distributed Cloud Customer Edge - Azure Deployment

Automated deployment of F5 Distributed Cloud (XC) Customer Edge nodes to Microsoft Azure using Terraform with GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.

## Overview

Deploy F5 XC Customer Edge instances to Azure using infrastructure-as-code with fully automated CI/CD pipeline. This solution implements hub-and-spoke network architecture with CE AppStack NVA in the hub and CE Managed Kubernetes in the spoke.

**Key Features**:
- âœ… Fully automated deployment via GitHub Actions
- âœ… Hub-and-spoke network architecture with high availability
- âœ… Secure workload identity federation (no secrets)
- âœ… Encrypted remote state management

## Prerequisites

- **Azure**: Subscription with Contributor access
- **F5 XC**: Distributed Cloud account with API token
- **GitHub**: Repository with Actions enabled

## Quick Deployment

### 1. Azure Backend Setup

```bash
./scripts/setup-backend.sh
```

This creates the Azure storage account for Terraform state management.

### 2. Configure GitHub Secrets

Add these secrets in your repository settings (Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions):

| Secret | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` | Azure AD application ID for workload identity |
| `AZURE_TENANT_ID` | Your Azure AD tenant ID |
| `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | Target Azure subscription ID |
| `F5_XC_API_TOKEN` | F5 XC Console API token |

### 3. Deploy Infrastructure

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy CE to Azure"
git push
```

GitHub Actions automatically validates and deploys your infrastructure. Monitor progress in the Actions tab.
